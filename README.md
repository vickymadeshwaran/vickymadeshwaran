### Career Potential/Experience

- Developed and tested an automated hand sanitization android app using Android Studio for an overseas client
- Created a local host for web-based registration form using HTML\PHP and interfaced the user information to Azure Cloud Database
- Interfaced various peripherals with SPI & UART for various micro controller architectures
- Designed a web based graphical console for industrial real time status monitoring/control system for digital inputs and outputs using Raspberry Pi 3 and Nano Pi Neo through Ethernet TCP/IP. [The functionality of the proposed model has been migrated from existing PLC system to Embedded Controller with minor advancements]

### Embedded IoT Training Project Experience

#### 1.Image Steganography using LSB Encoding & Decoding
- An innovative technology to hide information within image file and the path where the user wants to save image and extruded file. In digital images the message is concealed within the lowest bits of image. Without changing the size of the image, the information has been encrypted into the image. If exceeds the level then the size of image get crashed.
##### Programming Language/Techniques Used
- Embedded C – File operations, Pointers, Bitwise operations, Functions, Command line arguments
##### Key Challenges & Learnings
- Learned to transform the embedded information to the destination without changing properties of the original image 
- Overcame difficulties while performing bitwise manipulation of data to embed as well to retrieve the data from the destination image which has been solved after self-introspection

#### 2.Industrial Machine State Monitoring System
- The purpose of this machine is to connect two ESP with each other as it senses DHT 11 humidity value from one ESP and send that data to another ESP through Wi-Fi. The 2nd ESP was connected to Thing Speak through API key to get data and display data in graphical form. Second ESP was connected to mobile hot-spot to access data and send to Thing Speak. Hence, humidity value get continuously gathered and send to cloud to show graphical data.
##### Programming Language/Techniques Used
- Arduino, ESP32 Node MCU
##### Key Challenges & Learnings
- This project helps to learn creating APN and Client to communicate with each other to send and share data to cloud.
