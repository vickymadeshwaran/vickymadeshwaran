### Hi there 👋, Vignesh

#### Embedded Software Developer

### About Me
- I am a Budding Embedded Software Engineer Actively Looking for immediate Full-Time Opportunities in Embedded Software/IoT domain. Altogether I have 1 year of experience in the industry

### Skill
- C Programming
- HTML / CSS 
- PHP
- Java (Android App Development)

### PLATFORMS
####   OS/Software Packages/Server
- LINUX [Ubuntu]
- Windows
- Android Studio
- XAMPP
- Visual Studio

#### Development Boards & Kits
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Arduino UNO
- Nano Pi Neo V1.3

#### Communication Protocols
- SPI
- UART
- Ethernet TCP/IP

### Career Potential/Experience

- Developed and tested an automated hand sanitization android app using Android Studio for an overseas client
- Created a local host for web-based registration form using HTML\PHP and interfaced the user information to Azure Cloud Database
- Interfaced various peripherals with SPI & UART for various micro controller architectures
- Designed a web based graphical console for industrial real time status monitoring/control system for digital inputs and outputs using Raspberry Pi 3 and Nano Pi Neo through Ethernet TCP/IP. [The functionality of the proposed model has been migrated from existing PLC system to Embedded Controller with minor advancements]

### Embedded IoT Training Project Experience

#### 1.Image Steganography using LSB Encoding & Decoding
- An innovative technology to hide information within image file and the path where the user wants to save image and extruded file. In digital images the message is concealed within the lowest bits of image. Without changing the size of the image, the information has been encrypted into the image. If exceeds the level then the size of image get crashed.
##### Programming Language/Techniques Used
- Embedded C – File operations, Pointers, Bitwise operations, Functions, Command line arguments
##### Key Challenges & Learnings
- Learned to transform the embedded information to the destination without changing properties of the original image 
- Overcame difficulties while performing bitwise manipulation of data to embed as well to retrieve the data from the destination image which has been solved after self-introspection
